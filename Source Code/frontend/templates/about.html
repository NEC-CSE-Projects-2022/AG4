    <h1>About the Project</h1>

    <p>
      The <b>Heart Disease Detection System</b> is a web-based deep learning
      application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using
      essential clinical and physiological parameters.  
    </p>
    <p>
  The predictive model was trained using the
  <b>Cleveland Heart Disease dataset</b>, one of the most widely used datasets
  in cardiovascular research. With proper data preprocessing, normalization, and
  attention-enhanced layers, the system achieves a high level of prediction accuracy.

    <p>
      This model integrates <b>machine learning</b> and
      <b>deep learning</b> approaches, leveraging the
      <b>Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Hybrid Refined Ensemble Framework  (BiLSTM + HREF)</b> architecture.
      The system analyzes features such as age, cholesterol levels, resting blood
      pressure, ECG readings, and more to identify early signs of heart disease.
